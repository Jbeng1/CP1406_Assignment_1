	<h1>CossiePlay Party</h1>
    <p>On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).

Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only.
