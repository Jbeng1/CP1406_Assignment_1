<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Joshua Joseph Bengochea<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc299619</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The website is intended to increase the revenue for CossiePlay. It will do this by drawing younger people to the business. The website will also act as a place to sign up for CossiePlay's month cosplay parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The way that the success of this website will be evaluated is through tracking the number of sales made by people of the age 16 to 21 years of age. This is because that client has clearly stated that they want this website to bring in younger customers as their current customer base is between the age of 35-50. Another way of evaluating the success of the site will be tracking the number of people come to their monthly cosplay parties and the overall number of sales.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience that this site is intended for is people that are the age of 16 to 21 years of age. This in direct relation to the mission of the site and what is inteaded to achive. This will be down by making each page not have the much text. This is because with the rise of place's like facebook and twitter young people dont have as much of an atention spane and it will be easyer to keep there atention when there is not much for them to read.</p>
